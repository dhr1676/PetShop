### Project Brief Description
Many people and families like to have pets. At the same time, many people choose to adopt pets from animal welfare platform, which not only satisfield the needs of pets, but also eased the pressure of animal welfare platform.     
Our project is to build a information platform for animal welfare platform to show pet data to users who want to adopt pets.      
      
If DB users are registraeted as customers, the users can choose their favorite pets by setting rule filters, such as pet breed, fur color, or health condition.     

If DB users are registrated as consumers, the users can post their pets' data on the platform, and the pets' data would be stored in the database.      

### Data Domain and the Funcitionality
An EER model is presented in Appendix I.      

Functionality:      
Users as consumers should have the access to create data tuples, read tuples, update tuples and delete tuples.      
Users as customers should have the access to read data tuples by using rule filters.      

The frontend part should have the functionality to allow the customers to view the data and to set the rule filters, and the consumers to modify data.      
The backend part connect the frontend and the database, and provide the necessary functionalities.      

### SQL Storage
We plan to use SQL storage to store the data. Because our model is a relational model which can be easily managed by the SQL.

### Realization of the Project
We plan to use Python as the backend part programming language, using some frameworks like Django or Flask.     
And we plan to use Javascript as the frontend part programming language. ??????     

### Reason to Choose this Data Domain
Because we like animals. Millions of stray animals suffer on the streets or are euthanized in shelters every day around the world. If homes can be found for them, many precious lives can be saved â€” and more happy families created.
